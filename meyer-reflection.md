What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with navigating the GitHub website and the actual meaning of some of the terms used in the git workflow. For example, I had an understanding of what origin did, but couldn't speak to it very well. 
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I now can speak to what origin means. I also now have a better understanding of how to view the merge conflict results and how to resolve them. 
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about how to navigate through the various portions of GitHub. The first time I used it I was confused about how to access the different areas of the repository, so the GPS really helped clear that up. 
I also asked for various explanations around merging branches. 
What still confuses you about Git?
I think I need to continue researching the commands that are usable within git. Reading the discussion about merge conflicts on stackoverflow helped me realize this.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great! I really appreciated the opportunity to pair with a guide. It's a good experience pairing with other students often, and to have a guide there to facilitate discussion really helps. I thought our guide Kit did a great job at jumping in and clarifying when we needed assistance.
