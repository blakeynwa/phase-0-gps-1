    What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? 
    *I Was struggling branching and merging. I noticed that I was merging with master prior to pushing a feature branch to github. Everything is all clear now.


    What concepts were clarified during the GPS? 
    *I was under the impression that in order to run git pull command from the terminal, that I had to be under the master branch. It doesn't matter what branch I'm in. All that matters is the branch that I'm pulling/fetching.

    What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    *I asked if fetch and pull were the same thing. I found out they are not. Git pull fetches AND merges the branch. Git Fetch only fetches the branch.


    What still confuses you about Git?I have a pretty good understanding on Git now.


    How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? 
    *It went better than I thought! It helps having a pair that also knows the material. Looking forward to the next one!
